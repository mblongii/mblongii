The current issue of Communication Arts magazine stood out like a beach ball on a battlefield among the models, superstars, and politicians. The magazine rack gyrated in a pattern that blurred them all together; they were all the same. I ultimately found inspiration, and aspiration, in a design magazine.

> I admired the influence those artists, designers, and photographers had over the fickle tastes of our visual culture.

Quality comes from practice and passion; for the next two weeks my new Pentax camera would burn through two dozen rolls of film. The subdued inspiration of suburban people, architecture, and rolling foothills were the subjects for my nascent artistic endeavor.

A year later, I walked into the media lab across the bridge from my university. After reviewing my photography portfolio, they offered me a job to run a couple of their darkrooms. Color, composition, and chemistry were my teachers now, and the darkroom was their lectern. 

One of the technicians took me under his wing and said, _The future is digital, Mike. You should buy a Mac and learn Photoshop_. And later he said, _Apple’s putting UNIX in every computer they make, so you should learn that too_. I took his advice, and it changed the course of my life.

> My curiosity about digital photography led me to go deeper into the fractal world of computers and the internet.

As it was unboxed, that fresh-from-the-factory scent wafted from my new Mac. I immediately installed Linux on it. It took me about a week to get the video card working properly. Otherwise, I would have been stuck in the land of 640x480x8. Or worse yet, working in Mac OS 9. 

Thanks to the UNIX programming class I took in college, Linux felt familiar enough and I could immediately commence hacking on the digital design workstation of my open source dreams.

> I spent countless hours building PHP websites, creating 3D worlds in Blender, and editing my photos in GIMP. 

Shortly after I moved to Seattle, I got my first job as a designer. My interview was basically a crash course where I storyboarded, designed, and animated an interactive experience for a line of network diagnostics products. It was a small studio, and they let me take responsibility for anything I could wrap my head around. Toward the end of my tenure there I had been an IT admin, motion graphics designer, web designer, sound editor, and video editor.

> I didn’t want to go into advertising.

I really enjoyed animation and motion graphics, but I didn’t want to make commercials or banner ads. I thought about game design, but I heard horror stories of long hours, low pay, and job instability. I pursued a career in the training and simulation space instead. 

Shortly after moving to Austin, I got a job at an e-learning company. Over a period of two years my roles included: Lead designer, art director, interaction designer, and information architect. I worked with teams of instructional designers, writers, illustrators, programmers, and animators.

While I did feel like I was making a tiny dent in the universe, I felt like I was still teetering on the edge of making stuff that people only experience once.

> I wanted to make meaningful products and tools that people depended on for their lives and livelihood.

Then, I joined a defense contractor located outside of Austin that had a massive contract with the Army. The R&D team thre needed help with usability improvements for a logistics product that troops used in the field. I went on to help form a new group in the same company that tackled problems in civilian healthcare and civilian logistics.

> I started a healthy design practice and hired experienced people who could help make the design practice even better.

The transformational point in my career was joining ThoughtWorks. I learned to let go of control and embrace emergent design. I empowered team members and customers to participate in design. This was the way I always wanted to work, yet I felt like people still wanted a fully baked solution before development started, i.e., waterfall development. We needed to balance getting our ducks in a row while also unleashing the creativity and experience of team members and customers; people who weren’t necessarily ordained as designers.

Thanks to shorter iterations and the willingness of teams to participate in hands-on workshops, I learned how to bring design thinking to teams practicing Agile and XP (eXtreme Programming). We could learn by shipping and iterate quickly on user feedback. In turn, the products we created ensured our customers could keep their feedback loops short in their projects too.

> The way ThoughtWorks worked and how we empowered clients to adopt Agile methods drew me closer to universal principles of humanity, not just design.

Eventually, I joined Pivotal to work on Cloud Foundry. It seemed inevitable given my experience. The people who hired me knew me so well, mostly through social connections, that my interview involved a casual beer and a considerable amount of pressure to say yes and start the next day.

> Pivotal was like a playground where we constantly experimented with new ways to integrate design thinking with fast-moving technology teams.

The onboarding to Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry platform started with a whiteboard session called Boxes & Arrows. I was totally lost. I needed use cases and personas to do my work. It was like shooting for the moon with rocket fuel in one hand a blueprint in the other. It took another three months to figure out how the individual teams rolled up to help users achieve their goals. In spite of a harrowing ramp up period, I did my best to contribute on the first day.

> When I joined Pivotal, there were only two designers working on Cloud Foundry; including me.

After nearly 5 years at Pivotal, I had contributed to just about every aspect of the product: Command line interface design, documentation, customer onboarding, etc. As a product design manager, I collated onboarding materials from customer training content nearly six times because the product would evolve as soon as I had discovered a digestible doc or video. And even when a designer had Cloud experience in their background, we still had to plan for a significant ramp-up period.

> I stayed with Pivotal because of the people and the positive impact we were making in the world.

Four years later, we IPO’d. Then, a year after the IPO I took a sabbatical so I could focus on writing a young adult novel and a screenplay. After several months of developing some ideas, I realized that I missed collaboration and connection with colleagues. I can still write in my free time, and probably enjoy doing it more than if I had to do it like my life depended on it.
