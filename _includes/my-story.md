I remember the first time I picked up a Communication Arts magazine at Barnes & Noble. It was the February 1997 issue featuring SF Bay Area photographer RJ Muna. As I thumbed from back to front of those glossy pages, I felt that I wanted to be part of that world. I felt a kind of kinship with RJ Muna: how he talked about his goals, and his work.

> I tried to imagine the people behind the work in that design magazine and I saw thoughtful, creative people wielding a subtle power over our culture.

I bought an affordable Pentax camera the very next day. I had no idea what I was doing. I burned through two dozen rolls of film in one week, and made as many trips to the 1-hour photo lab to get them processed. Shoot, process, iterate.

Soon after teaching myself photography, I worked in a professional darkroom just across the river from the Boise State University campus. I was hired on the spot when I showed them my photography portfolio. I learned so much at that place about color, composition, and visual storytelling. Then, one of the technicians  took me under his wing and said, _The future is digital, Mike. You should buy a Mac and learn Photoshop_. I took his advice, and it changed my life.

> My curiosity about digital photography led me to go deeper into the fractal world of computers and the internet. 

At home, I installed Linux on my PowerMac G4 (before the release of Mac OS X) and I spent countless hours building websites with PHP, creating 3D worlds with Blender, and editing my photos with GIMP. **Thanks to the UNIX programming class I took in college, Linux felt familiar** and I knew enough to be dangerous. I immediately commenced hacking on the digital design workstation of my open source dreams. It took me about a week to get the video card working properly, otherwise I would've been stuck in the land of 640x480x16. Or worse yet, forced to use Mac OS 9.

Shortly after I moved to Seattle, **I got my first job as a designer**.  My interview was basically a crash course where I storyboarded, designed, and animated an interactive experience for a line of network diagnostics products. It was a small studio, and they let me take responsibility for anything I could wrap my head around. Toward the end of my tenure there I had been a Linux admin, motion graphics designer, web designer, editor, director, and producer.

> I didn’t want to go into advertising.

I really enjoyed animation and motion graphics, but I didn't want to make commercials or banner ads. I thought about game design, but I heard horror stories of long hours, low pay, and job instability. I pursued a career in the training and simulation space instead. Shortly after moving to Austin, I got a job at an e-learning company. Over a period of two years my roles included: Lead designer, art director, interaction designer, and information architect. I worked with teams of instructional designers, writers, illustrators, programmers, and animators.

While I did feel like I was making a tiny dent in the universe, I still felt like I was teetering on the edge making stuff that people experienced only once. 

> I wanted to make meaningful products and tools that people depended on for their life and livelihood.

After I left e-elearning, I joined a defense contractor located outside of Austin that had a massive contract with the Army. I helped the core R&D team there with usability improvements in a logistics product that troops used in the field. I then went on to help form a new group in the company that tackled problems in civilian healthcare and civilian logistics. 

> I started a healthy design practice there and hired senior people who helped make the design practice even better.

The transformational point in my career was joining ThoughtWorks.  I learned to let go a little and embrace emergent design; **empower team members and customers to participate in design**.  This was the way I always wanted to work, but I felt like people wanted a fully baked solution before development started, i.e., waterfall development. I felt we needed a balance between getting our ducks in a row and unleashing the creativity and experience of people who weren't ordained as designers.

Thanks to shorter iterations and the willingness of teams to participate in workshops, I learned how to bring design thinking to teams practicing Agile and XP (eXtreme Programming).  We could **learn by shipping and iterate quickly on user feedback**. In turn, the tools I helped create ensured our customers could keep those feedback loops short in their projects too.

> The way ThoughtWorks worked and how we empowered clients to adopt Agile methods drew me closer to universal principles of humanity, not just design.

Eventually, **I joined Pivotal to work on Cloud Foundry**.  It seemed inevitable given my experience.  The people who hired me knew me so well, mostly through social connections, that my interview involved a casual beer and a considerable amount of pressure to say _yes_ and start the next day. 

> Pivotal was like a playground where we constantly experimented with new ways to integrate design thinking with fast-moving technology teams.

My first introduction to Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry platform entailed a whiteboard session called _Boxes &amp; Arrows_. The Product Manager on the team I had just joined walked me through the architectural model of PCF. I was totally lost. **I needed use cases and personas to do my work**. It was like shooting for the moon with rocket fuel in one hand a blueprint in the other. It took me another three months to figure out how the individual teams rolled up to strategic goals. In spite of a harrowing ramp up period, I did my best to contribute on the first day.

> When I joined Pivotal, there were only two designers working on Cloud Foundry; including me.

After nearly 5 years at Pivotal, I had contributed to just about every aspect of the product: Command line interface design, documentation, customer onboarding, etc. As a product design _manager_, I collated onboarding materials from customer training content nearly six times because the product would evolve as soon as I had discovered a digestible doc or video. And even when a designer had _Cloud_ experience in their background, we still had to plan for a significant ramp-up period.

> I stayed with Pivotal because of the _People_.

Four years later, we IPO’d.  I cashed out and took a sabbatical so I could focus on writing a young adult novel and a screenplay.  After several months of developing some ideas, I realized that I missed **collaboration and connection with colleagues**.  I can still write the next great novel in my free time, and probably enjoy doing it more than if I had to do it like my life depended on it.
