The February 1997 issue of Communication Arts magazine stood out like a beach ball on a battlefield among the supermodels, superstars, and the ugly-famous of Washington DC. The magazine rack gyrated in a pattern that blurred them all together; they were all the same. I reached for the only inspiration I could find: an iconic photograph by RJ Muna.

> Thumbing from back to front of those glossy magazine pages, I admired the influence those artists and designers had over our fickle cultural desires.

Quality comes from practice and passion. For the next two weeks, my new Pentax camera would burn through two dozen rolls of black and white film. The subdued inspiration of suburban people, architecture, and the rolling foothills were the subjects for my nascent artistic endeavor.

I walked into the media lab across the bridge from the university. After reviewing my photography portfolio, they offered me a job to run a couple of their darkrooms. Color, composition, and chemistry were my teachers now, and the darkroom was the lectern. One of the technicians took me under his wing and said, _The future is digital, Mike. You should buy a Mac and learn Photoshop_. And later he said, _Apple will soon put UNIX in every computer they make, so you should learn that too_. I took his advice, and it changed the course of my life.

> My curiosity about digital photography led me to go deeper into the fractal world of computers and the internet. 

At home, I installed Linux on my PowerMac G4 (before the release of Mac OS X) and I spent countless hours building websites with PHP, creating 3D worlds with Blender, and editing my photos with GIMP. **Thanks to the UNIX programming class I took in college, Linux felt familiar** and I knew enough to be dangerous. I immediately commenced hacking on the digital design workstation of my open source dreams. It took me about a week to get the video card working properly, otherwise I would've been stuck in the land of 640x480x16. Or worse yet, forced to use Mac OS 9.

Shortly after I moved to Seattle, **I got my first job as a designer**.  My interview was basically a crash course where I storyboarded, designed, and animated an interactive experience for a line of network diagnostics products. It was a small studio, and they let me take responsibility for anything I could wrap my head around. Toward the end of my tenure there I had been a Linux admin, motion graphics designer, web designer, editor, director, and producer.

> I didn’t want to go into advertising.

I really enjoyed animation and motion graphics, but I didn't want to make commercials or banner ads. I thought about game design, but I heard horror stories of long hours, low pay, and job instability. I pursued a career in the training and simulation space instead. Shortly after moving to Austin, I got a job at an e-learning company. Over a period of two years my roles included: Lead designer, art director, interaction designer, and information architect. I worked with teams of instructional designers, writers, illustrators, programmers, and animators.

While I did feel like I was making a tiny dent in the universe, I still felt like I was teetering on the edge making stuff that people experienced only once. 

> I wanted to make meaningful products and tools that people depended on for their life and livelihood.

After I left e-elearning, I joined a defense contractor located outside of Austin that had a massive contract with the Army. I helped the core R&D team there with usability improvements in a logistics product that troops used in the field. I then went on to help form a new group in the company that tackled problems in civilian healthcare and civilian logistics. 

> I started a healthy design practice there and hired senior people who helped make the design practice even better.

The transformational point in my career was joining ThoughtWorks.  I learned to let go a little and embrace emergent design; **empower team members and customers to participate in design**.  This was the way I always wanted to work, but I felt like people wanted a fully baked solution before development started, i.e., waterfall development. I felt we needed a balance between getting our ducks in a row and unleashing the creativity and experience of people who weren't ordained as designers.

Thanks to shorter iterations and the willingness of teams to participate in workshops, I learned how to bring design thinking to teams practicing Agile and XP (eXtreme Programming).  We could **learn by shipping and iterate quickly on user feedback**. In turn, the tools I helped create ensured our customers could keep those feedback loops short in their projects too.

> The way ThoughtWorks worked and how we empowered clients to adopt Agile methods drew me closer to universal principles of humanity, not just design.

Eventually, **I joined Pivotal to work on Cloud Foundry**.  It seemed inevitable given my experience.  The people who hired me knew me so well, mostly through social connections, that my interview involved a casual beer and a considerable amount of pressure to say _yes_ and start the next day. 

> Pivotal was like a playground where we constantly experimented with new ways to integrate design thinking with fast-moving technology teams.

My first introduction to Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry platform entailed a whiteboard session called _Boxes &amp; Arrows_. The Product Manager on the team I had just joined walked me through the architectural model of PCF. I was totally lost. **I needed use cases and personas to do my work**. It was like shooting for the moon with rocket fuel in one hand a blueprint in the other. It took me another three months to figure out how the individual teams rolled up to strategic goals. In spite of a harrowing ramp up period, I did my best to contribute on the first day.

> When I joined Pivotal, there were only two designers working on Cloud Foundry; including me.

After nearly 5 years at Pivotal, I had contributed to just about every aspect of the product: Command line interface design, documentation, customer onboarding, etc. As a product design _manager_, I collated onboarding materials from customer training content nearly six times because the product would evolve as soon as I had discovered a digestible doc or video. And even when a designer had _Cloud_ experience in their background, we still had to plan for a significant ramp-up period.

> I stayed with Pivotal because of the _People_.

Four years later, we IPO’d.  I cashed out and took a sabbatical so I could focus on writing a young adult novel and a screenplay.  After several months of developing some ideas, I realized that I missed **collaboration and connection with colleagues**.  I can still write the next great novel in my free time, and probably enjoy doing it more than if I had to do it like my life depended on it.
